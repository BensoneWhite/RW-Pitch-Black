I hear… Nothing.

Well, except for those distorted chimes and bells ringing, endlessly

But I can't hear the buzzing anymore, the chitter chatter muted.

Have those long dead voices been put to rest? 

After all this time, can they see the other side of the rubicon?

Why leave me here to suffer in silence, take me with you…
