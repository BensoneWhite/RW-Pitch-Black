[[ DEVELOPER COMMENTARY ]]

Initiating Exocyclic Relay.

Tryn: You found me!! I hope you're enjoying my dialogue so far!
Tryn: Alot of the Overseer Carcass dialogue was a blast to write!<LINE>the overall purpose of these were to give you a glimpse into the world of PB.<LINE>And especially how the world in pitch black can be super bleak at times.
Tryn: But sometimes nature prevails! And you get all of the wacky creatures that Moon and the others have made.<LINE> I hope you like them!!
Tryn: Another cool detail: The relay system wasnt inherently designed to access overseer memory.<LINE> And so you can see our friend set up a seperate format through a firmware update specially for them!<LINE> Makes them feel more secretive and special to read if you ask me!
Tryn: Thank you for reading! Good luck finding the rest of these! >:)
